# Lawvriksh Frontend Assignment - Cover Note

This repository contains my submission for the **Lawvriksh Frontend Assignment**, completed in two phases.  

**Phase 1:** Implemented a responsive **dashboard** displaying tasks and overall workload. The dashboard includes tabs for task categorization, status badges, and a bubble chart for team workload. All components are responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.  

**Phase 2:** Built a **project summary table** and overall progress visualization. The table shows project details, status, and circular progress indicators. The progress gauge displays the overall completion percentage along with key project statistics. All interactive elements are implemented with **React** and **Lucide icons** for consistency and user-friendly UI.  

The project demonstrates clean code structure, reusable components, and attention to responsive design. Live version is hosted via GitHub Pages.
